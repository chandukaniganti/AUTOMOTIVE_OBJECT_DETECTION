#  Automotive Object Detection — YOLOv8

An advanced **AI/ML-based Automotive Object Detection System** built using **Ultralytics YOLOv8**.  
This project detects and tracks vehicles, pedestrians, and other road objects in real-time or from recorded videos.

##  Overview

This project demonstrates how AI can improve **driver assistance** and **road safety** by detecting surrounding objects such as:
- Cars, trucks, and buses  
- Motorbikes and bicycles  
- Pedestrians and traffic elements  

It uses the **YOLOv8n** model for fast and efficient real-time object detection on road videos or webcam input.
